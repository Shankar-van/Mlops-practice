1. class -object(example)
2. class has data attribute and func /methods 
      > Code walkthrough
      > Attributes get called itself , methods are called Manually   
3. Why python is called Object oriented Programming languague?  Everything in python is an object
      whether it is datastructure , data type etc.

4. Advantages of  oops:
        > you can create  your own datatype 
        > code Reusability 
        > debugging
        > easy to colab


5. End to End project (chat book project)
    > function vs method 
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > you can Create Attribute outside class as well 


    > encapsulatioon
    > getter and setter
    > static method 

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritace code example 
    > Why inheritance is needed ?(code reusability, parent has noo access to child class)
    > What gets inherited? - constructer ,non privaate attributes, Nonprivate methods 
    > constructor overlosding & method overloading 
    > super keyword (can be used only inside class, can not acess variables/attributes, used only inside child class)

    > Types of inheritance - 1. single Inheritance | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hieerarchical | 4. muliple <Diamond Problem> | 5. Hybrid
